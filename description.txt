This mod add a new pre-hardmode powerful weapon: The Buff Sword

The recipe of the Buff Sword is:
-1 platinium/gold broadsword 
-5 of every Vanilla flower (Blinkroot, Daybloom, Deathweed, Fireblossom, Moonglow, Shiverthorn, Waterleaf)
can be crafted only on placed bottle or alchemy table

this sword also can be used to create a more powerful counterpart in hardmode: The Buffer Sword, craftable only with the Crystal Ball

those Swords have a strange feature: if you deal critical damage with Them, you receive a random buff for less than a minute (only potion buffs with Buff sword, special buff for Buffer Sword)

enjoy my mod and Report in the homepage (via issue) for bug and problem with the mod (or just to help me find ideas)

Warning! the sprite of "The Buffer Sword" is not finished yet!
