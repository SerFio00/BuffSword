This mod add a new pre-hardmode powerful weapon: The Buff Sword

this Sword has a strange feature: if you deal critical damage with this sword, you receive a random buff for 30 seconds (only potion buffs)

The recipe of the Buff Sword is:
-1 platinium/gold broadsword 
-5 of every Vanilla flower (Blinkroot, Daybloom, Deathweed, Fireblossom, Moonglow, Shiverthorn, Waterleaf)

can be crafted only on placed bottle or alchemy table

enjoy my mod!
